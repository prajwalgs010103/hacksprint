When the computer system is executing a user application, the system is in user mode. When a user application requests a service from the operating system (via a system call), the transition from user to kernel mode takes place. At system boot time, the hardware starts in kernel mode. The operating system is then loaded and starts user applications in user mode. Whenever a trap or interrupt occurs, the hardware switches from user mode to kernel mode (that is, changes the mode bit from 1 to 0). Thus, whenever the operating system gains control of the computer, it is in kernel mode. <br>b) Timer <br>Operating system uses timer to control the CPU. A user program cannot hold CPU for a long time, this is prevented with the help of timer. A timer can be set to interrupt the computer after a specified period.<br> The period may be fixed (for example, 1/60 second) or variable (for example, from 1 millisecond to 1 second). <br>Fixed timer – After a fixed time, the process under execution is interrupted.<br> Variable timer – Interrupt occurs after varying interval.';

It provides certain services to programs and to the users of those programs. <br>OS provide services for the users of the system, including:         <br>• User Interfaces - Means by which users can issue commands to the system. Command-line interface ( e.g. sh, csh, ksh, tcsh, etc.), a Graphical User Interface (e.g. Windows, X-Windows, KDE, Gnome, etc.), <br>• Program Execution - The OS must be able to load a program into RAM, run the program, and terminate the program, either normally or abnormally. <br>• I/O Operations - The OS is responsible for transferring data to and from I/O devices, including keyboards, terminals, printers, and files. For specific devices, special functions are provided(device drivers) by OS. <br>• File-System Manipulation – Programs need to read and write files or directories. The services required to create or delete files, search for a file, list the contents of a file and change the file permissions are provided by OS. <br>• Communications - Inter-process communications, IPC, either between processes running on the same processor, or between processes running on separate processors or separate machines. May be implemented by using the service of OSlike shared memory or message passing. <br>• Error Detection - Both hardware and software errors must be detected and handled appropriately by the OS. Errors may occur in the CPU and memory hardware (such as power failure and memory error), in I/O devices (such as a parity error on tape, a connection failure on a network, or lack of paper in the printer), and in the user program (such as an arithmetic overflow, an attempt to access an illegal memory location). OS provide services for the efficient operation of the system, including: <br>• Resource Allocation – Resources like CPU cycles, main memory, storage space, and I/O devices must be allocated to multiple users and multiple jobs at the same time. <br>• Accounting – There are services in OS to keep track of system activity and resource usage, either for billing purposes or for statistical record keeping that can be used to optimize future performance. <br>• Protection and Security – The owners of information(file) in multiuser or networked computer system may want to control the use of that information. When several separate processes execute concurrently, one process should not interfere with other or with OS. Protection involves ensuring that all access to system resources is controlled. Security of the system from outsiders must also be done, by means of a password.';

        return 'OS structure must be carefully designed. The task of OS is divided into small components and then interfaced to work together. <br>1) Simple Structure <br>Many operating systems do not have well-defined structures. They started as small, simple, and limited systems and then grew beyond their original scope. Ex: MS-DOS. In MS-DOS, the interfaces and levels of functionality are not well separated. Application programs can access basic I/O routines to write directly to the display and disk drives. Such freedom leaves MS-DOS in bad state and the entire system can crash down when user programs fail.<br>2) Layered Approach <br>The OS is broken into number of layers (levels). Each layer rests on the layer below it, and relies on the services provided by the next lower layer. <br>• Bottom layer(layer 0) is the hardware and the topmost layer is the user interface. <br>• A typical layer, consists of data structure and routines that can be invoked by higher-level layer. <br><br>Advantages of layered approach is simplicity of construction and debugging. -> The layers are selected so that each uses functions and services of only lower-level layers. -> So simplifies debugging and system verification. -> The layers are debugged one by one from the lowest and if any layer doesn’t work, then error is due to that layer only, as the lower layers are already debugged. -> Thus the design and implementation is simplified. -> A layer need not know how its lower level layers are implemented. Thus hides the operations from higher layers. <br><br>Disadvantages of layered approach: <br>• The various layers must be appropriately defined, as a layer can use only lower level layers. <br>• Less efficient than other types, because any interaction with layer 0 required from top layer. The system call should pass through all the layers and finally to layer 0. This is an overhead. <br>3) Microkernels <br>• The basic idea behind micro kernels is to remove all non-essential services from the kernel, thus making the kernel as small and efficient as possible. <br>• The removed services are implemented as system applications. <br>• Most microkernels provide basic process and memory management, and message passing between other services. <br>• Benefit of microkernel - System expansion can also be easier, because it only involves adding more system applications, not rebuilding a new kernel. <br>• Mach was the first and most widely known microkernel, and now forms a major component of Mac OSX. <br><br>Disadvantage of Microkernel is, it suffers from reduction in performance due to increases system function overhead.<br><br>4) Modules <br>• Modern OS development is object-oriented, with a relatively small core kernel and a set of modules which can be linked in dynamically. <br>• Modules are similar to layers in that each subsystem has clearly defined tasks and interfaces, but any module is free to contact any other module, eliminating the problems of going through multiple intermediary layers. <br>• The kernel is relatively small in this architecture, similar to microkernels, but the kernel does not have to implement message passing since modules are free to contact each other directly. Ex: Solaris, Linux and MacOSX. <br>• The Max OSX architecture relies on the Mach microkernel for basic system management services, and the BSD kernel for additional services. Application services and dynamically loadable modules ( kernel extensions ) provide the rest of the OS functionality. <br>• Resembles layered system, but a module can call any other module. <br>• Resembles microkernel, the primary module has only core functions and the knowledge of how to load and communicate with other modules.';
